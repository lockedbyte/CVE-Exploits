This is a sample sudo policy plugin.  See the sudo_plugin manual for
information on writing your own plugin.

The sample policy plugin is not built or installed by default.  To
build and install the plugin, change to the plugins/sample directory
and run "make".  It can be installed by running "make install" as
the superuser from the same directory.

To actually use the sample plugin, you'll need to modify the
/etc/sudo.conf file.  Caution: you should not make changes to
/etc/sudo.conf without also having a root shell open repair things
in case of an error.  To enable the plugin, first comment out any
existing policy Plugin line in /etc/sudo.conf, for example:

    Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so

Then add a line for the sample plugin:

    Plugin sample_policy sample_plugin.so

You may need to create /etc/sudo.conf if it does not already exist.

Note that you may only have a single policy plugin defined.
