DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ssuuddoorreeppllaayy plays back or lists the output logs created by ssuuddoo.  When
     replaying, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy can play the session back in real-time, or the
     playback speed may be adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command
     line options.

     The _I_D should either be a six character sequence of digits and upper case
     letters, e.g. 0100A5, or a pattern matching the _i_o_l_o_g___f_i_l_e option in the
     _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.  When a command is run via ssuuddoo with _l_o_g___o_u_t_p_u_t enabled in
     the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file, a TSID=ID string is logged via syslog or to the ssuuddoo
     log file.  The _I_D may also be determined using ssuuddoorreeppllaayy's list mode.

     In list mode, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy can be used to find the ID of a session based on
     a number of criteria such as the user, tty or command run.

     In replay mode, if the standard input and output are connected to a
     terminal and the --nn option is not specified, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy will operate
     interactively.  In interactive mode, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy will attempt to adjust
     the terminal size to match that of the session and write directly to the
     terminal (not all terminals support this).  Additionally, it will poll
     the keyboard and act on the following keys:

     `\n' or `\r'  Skip to the next replay event; useful for long pauses.

     ` ' (space)   Pause output; press any key to resume.

     `<'           Reduce the playback speed by one half.

     `>'           Double the playback speed.

     The session can be interrupted via control-C.  When the session has
     finished, the terminal is restored to its original size if it was changed
     during playback.

     The options are as follows:

     --dd _d_i_r, ----ddiirreeccttoorryy=_d_i_r
                 Store session logs in _d_i_r instead of the default,
                 _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_s_u_d_o_-_i_o.

     --ff _f_i_l_t_e_r, ----ffiilltteerr=_f_i_l_t_e_r
                 Select which I/O type(s) to display.  By default, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy
                 will display the command's standard output, standard error
                 and tty output.  The _f_i_l_t_e_r argument is a comma-separated
                 list, consisting of one or more of following: _s_t_d_i_n, _s_t_d_o_u_t,
                 _s_t_d_e_r_r, _t_t_y_i_n, and _t_t_y_o_u_t.

     --hh, ----hheellpp  Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.

     --ll, ----lliisstt [_s_e_a_r_c_h _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                 Enable "list mode".  In this mode, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy will list
                 available sessions in a format similar to the ssuuddoo log file
                 format, sorted by file name (or sequence number).  If a
                 _s_e_a_r_c_h _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is specified, it will be used to restrict
                 the IDs that are displayed.  An expression is composed of the
                 following predicates:

                 command _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
                         Evaluates to true if the command run matches the
                         POSIX extended regular expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

                 cwd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                         specified current working directory.

                 fromdate _d_a_t_e
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run on or after
                         _d_a_t_e.  See _D_a_t_e _a_n_d _t_i_m_e _f_o_r_m_a_t for a description of
                         supported date and time formats.

                 group _r_u_n_a_s___g_r_o_u_p
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                         specified _r_u_n_a_s___g_r_o_u_p.  Note that unless a
                         _r_u_n_a_s___g_r_o_u_p was explicitly specified when ssuuddoo was
                         run this field will be empty in the log.

                 runas _r_u_n_a_s___u_s_e_r
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run as the
                         specified _r_u_n_a_s___u_s_e_r.  Note that ssuuddoo runs commands
                         as user _r_o_o_t by default.

                 todate _d_a_t_e
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run on or prior
                         to _d_a_t_e.  See _D_a_t_e _a_n_d _t_i_m_e _f_o_r_m_a_t for a description
                         of supported date and time formats.

                 tty _t_t_y _n_a_m_e
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
                         specified terminal device.  The _t_t_y _n_a_m_e should be
                         specified without the _/_d_e_v_/ prefix, e.g. _t_t_y_0_1
                         instead of _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_0_1.

                 user _u_s_e_r _n_a_m_e
                         Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command run by
                         _u_s_e_r _n_a_m_e.

                 Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique string.

                 Predicates may be combined using _a_n_d, _o_r and _! operators as
                 well as `(' and `)' grouping (note that parentheses must
                 generally be escaped from the shell).  The _a_n_d operator is
                 optional, adjacent predicates have an implied _a_n_d unless
                 separated by an _o_r.

     --mm, ----mmaaxx--wwaaiitt _m_a_x___w_a_i_t
                 Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key
                 presses or output data.  By default, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy will
                 accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or
                 program output.  However, this can be tedious when the
                 session includes long pauses.  When the --mm option is
                 specified, ssuuddoorreeppllaayy will limit these pauses to at most
                 _m_a_x___w_a_i_t seconds.  The value may be specified as a floating
                 point number, e.g. _2_._5.  A _m_a_x___w_a_i_t of zero or less will
                 eliminate the pauses entirely.

     --nn, ----nnoonn--iinntteerraaccttiivvee
                 Do not prompt for user input or attempt to re-size the
                 terminal.  The session is written to the standard output, not
                 directly to the user's terminal.

     --RR, ----nnoo--rreessiizzee
                 Do not attempt to re-size the terminal to match the terminal
                 size of the session.

     --ss, ----ssppeeeedd _s_p_e_e_d___f_a_c_t_o_r
                 This option causes ssuuddoorreeppllaayy to adjust the number of seconds
                 it will wait between key presses or program output.  This can
                 be used to slow down or speed up the display.  For example, a
                 _s_p_e_e_d___f_a_c_t_o_r of _2 would make the output twice as fast whereas
                 a _s_p_e_e_d___f_a_c_t_o_r of _._5 would make the output twice as slow.

     --VV, ----vveerrssiioonn
                 Print the ssuuddoorreeppllaayy versions version number and exit.

     The time and date may be specified multiple ways, common formats include:

     HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone
             24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm.

     HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone
             24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm, and month and day
             names may be abbreviated.  Note that month and day of the week
             names must be specified in English.

     CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
             ISO time format

     DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS
             The month name may be abbreviated.

     Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and timezone are optional.
     If no date is specified, the current day is assumed; if no time is
     specified, the first second of the specified date is used.  The less
     significant parts of both time and date may also be omitted, in which
     case zero is assumed.

     The following are all valid time and date specifications:

     now     The current time and date.

     tomorrow
             Exactly one day from now.

     yesterday
             24 hours ago.

     2 hours ago
             2 hours ago.

     next Friday
             The first second of the Friday in the next (upcoming) week.  Not
             to be confused with "this Friday" which would match the Friday of
             the current week.

     last week
             The current time but 7 days ago.  This is equivalent to "a week
             ago".

     a fortnight ago
             The current time but 14 days ago.

     10:01 am 9/17/2009
             10:01 am, September 17, 2009.

     10:01 am
             10:01 am on the current day.

     10      10:00 am on the current day.

     9/17/2009
             00:00 am, September 17, 2009.

     10:01 am Sep 17, 2009
             10:01 am, September 17, 2009.

     Note that relative time specifications do not always work as expected.
     For example, the "next" qualifier is intended to be used in conjunction
     with a day such as "next Monday".  When used with units of weeks, months,
     years, etc the result will be one more than expected.  For example, "next
     week" will result in a time exactly two weeks from now, which is probably
     not what was intended.  This will be addressed in a future version of
     ssuuddoorreeppllaayy.
