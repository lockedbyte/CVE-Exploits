NLS Translations for sudo are coordinated through the Translation
Project, at http://translationproject.org/

If you would like to contribute a translation for sudo, please join
a translation team at the Translation Project instead of contributing
a po file directly.  This will avoid duplicated work if there is
already a translation in progress.  If you would like to become a
member of a translation team, please follow the instructions at
http://translationproject.org/html/translators.html

The messages in sudo are split into two domains: sudo and sudoers.
The former is used by the sudo front-end and utility functions.
The latter is used by the sudoers policy and I/O logging plug-ins
as well as the sudoers-specific commands visudo and sudoreplay.
