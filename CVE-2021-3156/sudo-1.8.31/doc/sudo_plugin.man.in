.SH "NAME"
\fBsudo_plugin\fR
\- Sudo Plugin API
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Starting with version 1.8,
\fBsudo\fR
supports a plugin API
for policy and session logging.
Plugins may be compiled as dynamic shared objects (the default on
systems that support them) or compiled statically into the
\fBsudo\fR
binary itself.
By default, the
\fBsudoers\fR
policy plugin and an associated I/O logging plugin are used.
Via the plugin API,
\fBsudo\fR
can be configured to use alternate policy and/or I/O logging plugins
provided by third parties.
The plugins to be used are specified in the
sudo.conf(@mansectform@)
file.
.PP
The API is versioned with a major and minor number.
The minor version number is incremented when additions are made.
The major number is incremented when incompatible changes are made.
A plugin should be check the version passed to it and make sure that the
major version matches.
.PP
The plugin API is defined by the
\fRsudo_plugin.h\fR
header file.
.SS "Policy plugin API"
A policy plugin must declare and populate a
\fRpolicy_plugin\fR
struct in the global scope.
This structure contains pointers to the functions that implement the
\fBsudo\fR
policy checks.
The name of the symbol should be specified in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@)
along with a path to the plugin so that
\fBsudo\fR
can load it.

The policy_plugin struct has the following fields:
.TP 6n
type
The
\fRtype\fR
field should always be set to SUDO_POLICY_PLUGIN.
.TP 6n
version
The
\fRversion\fR
field should be set to
\fRSUDO_API_VERSION\fR.
.sp
This allows
\fBsudo\fR
to determine the API version the plugin was
built against.
.TP 6n

.nf
.RS 6n
int (*open)(unsigned int version, sudo_conv_t conversation,
            sudo_printf_t plugin_printf, char * const settings[],

            char * const plugin_options[]);
.RE

.RS 6n
.sp
Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,
or \-2 if there was a usage error.
In the latter case,
\fBsudo\fR
will print a usage message before it exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
\fBconversation\fR()
or
\fBplugin_printf\fR()
function with
\fRSUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG\fR
to present additional error information to the user.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
version
The version passed in by
\fBsudo\fR
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the plugin API supported by
\fBsudo\fR.
.TP 6n
conversation
A pointer to the
\fBconversation\fR()
function that can be used by the plugin to interact with the user (see below).
Returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
.TP 6n
plugin_printf
A pointer to a
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function that may be used to display informational or error messages
(see below).
Returns the number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.TP 6n
settings
A vector of user-supplied
\fBsudo\fR
settings in the form of
\(lqname=value\(rq
strings.
The vector is terminated by a
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
These settings correspond to options the user specified when running
\fBsudo\fR.
As such, they will only be present when the corresponding option has
been specified on the command line.
.sp
When parsing
\fIsettings\fR,
the plugin should split on the
\fBfirst\fR
equal sign
(\(oq=\(cq)
since the
\fIname\fR
field will never include one
itself but the
\fIvalue\fR
might.
.PP
.RS 6n
.PD 0
.TP 6n
bsdauth_type=string
Authentication type, if specified by the
\fB\-a\fR
option, to use on
systems where
BSD
authentication is supported.
.PD
.TP 6n
closefrom=number
If specified, the user has requested via the
\fB\-C\fR
option that
\fBsudo\fR
close all files descriptors with a value of
\fInumber\fR
or higher.
The plugin may optionally pass this, or another value, back in the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.TP 6n
debug_flags=string
A debug file path name followed by a space and a comma-separated
list of debug flags that correspond to the plugin's
\fRDebug\fR
entry in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@),
if there is one.
The flags are passed to the plugin exactly as they appear in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@).
The syntax used by
\fBsudo\fR
and the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin is
\fIsubsystem\fR@\fIpriority\fR
but a plugin is free to use a different
format so long as it does not include a comma
(\(oq,\&\(cq).
Prior to
\fBsudo\fR
1.8.12, there was no way to specify plugin-specific
\fIdebug_flags\fR
so the value was always the same as that used by the
\fBsudo\fR
front end and did not include a path name, only the flags themselves.
As of version 1.7 of the plugin interface,
\fBsudo\fR
will only pass
\fIdebug_flags\fR
if
sudo.conf(@mansectform@)
contains a plugin-specific
\fRDebug\fR
entry.
.TP 6n
debug_level=number
This setting has been deprecated in favor of
\fIdebug_flags\fR.
.TP 6n
ignore_ticket=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-k\fR
option along with a
command, indicating that the user wishes to ignore any cached
authentication credentials.
\fIimplied_shell\fR
to true.
This allows
\fBsudo\fR
with no arguments
to be used similarly to
su(1).
If the plugin does not to support this usage, it may return a value of \-2
from the
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function, which will cause
\fBsudo\fR
to print a usage message and
exit.
.TP 6n
implied_shell=bool
If the user does not specify a program on the command line,
\fBsudo\fR
will pass the plugin the path to the user's shell and set
.TP 6n
login_class=string
BSD
login class to use when setting resource limits and nice value,
if specified by the
\fB\-c\fR
option.
.TP 6n
login_shell=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-i\fR
option, indicating that
the user wishes to run a login shell.
.TP 6n
max_groups=int
The maximum number of groups a user may belong to.
This will only be present if there is a corresponding setting in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@).
.TP 6n
network_addrs=list
A space-separated list of IP network addresses and netmasks in the
form
\(lqaddr/netmask\(rq,
e.g.,
\(lq192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0\(rq.
The address and netmask pairs may be either IPv4 or IPv6, depending on
what the operating system supports.
If the address contains a colon
(\(oq:\&\(cq),
it is an IPv6 address, else it is IPv4.
.TP 6n
noninteractive=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-n\fR
option, indicating that
\fBsudo\fR
should operate in non-interactive mode.
The plugin may reject a command run in non-interactive mode if user
interaction is required.
.TP 6n
plugin_dir=string
The default plugin directory used by the
\fBsudo\fR
front end.
This is the default directory set at compile time and may not
correspond to the directory the running plugin was loaded from.
It may be used by a plugin to locate support files.
.TP 6n
plugin_path=string
The path name of plugin loaded by the
\fBsudo\fR
front end.
The path name will be a fully-qualified unless the plugin was
statically compiled into
\fBsudo\fR.
.TP 6n
preserve_environment=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-E\fR
option, indicating that
the user wishes to preserve the environment.
.TP 6n
preserve_groups=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-P\fR
option, indicating that
the user wishes to preserve the group vector instead of setting it
based on the runas user.
.TP 6n
progname=string
The command name that sudo was run as, typically
\(lqsudo\(rq
or
\(lqsudoedit\(rq.
.TP 6n
prompt=string
The prompt to use when requesting a password, if specified via
the
\fB\-p\fR
option.
.TP 6n
remote_host=string
The name of the remote host to run the command on, if specified via
the
\fB\-h\fR
option.
Support for running the command on a remote host is meant to be implemented
via a helper program that is executed in place of the user-specified command.
The
\fBsudo\fR
front end is only capable of executing commands on the local host.
Only available starting with API version 1.4.
.TP 6n
run_shell=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-s\fR
option, indicating that the user wishes to run a shell.
.TP 6n
runas_group=string
The group name or gid to run the command as, if specified via
the
\fB\-g\fR
option.
.TP 6n
runas_user=string
The user name or uid to run the command as, if specified via the
\fB\-u\fR
option.
.TP 6n
selinux_role=string
SELinux role to use when executing the command, if specified by
the
\fB\-r\fR
option.
.TP 6n
selinux_type=string
SELinux type to use when executing the command, if specified by
the
\fB\-t\fR
option.
.TP 6n
set_home=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-H\fR
option.
If true, set the
\fRHOME\fR
environment variable to the target user's home directory.
.TP 6n
sudoedit=bool
Set to true when the
\fB\-e\fR
option is specified or if invoked as
\fBsudoedit\fR.
The plugin shall substitute an editor into
\fIargv\fR
in the
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function or return \-2 with a usage error
if the plugin does not support
\fIsudoedit\fR.
For more information, see the
\fIcheck_policy\fR
section.
.TP 6n
timeout=string
User-specified command timeout.
Not all plugins support command timeouts and the ability for the
user to set a timeout may be restricted by policy.
The format of the timeout string is plugin-specific.
.PP
Additional settings may be added in the future so the plugin should
silently ignore settings that it does not recognize.
.RE
.TP 6n
user_info
A vector of information about the user running the command in the form of
\(lqname=value\(rq
strings.
The vector is terminated by a
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
.sp
When parsing
\fIuser_info\fR,
the plugin should split on the
\fBfirst\fR
equal sign
(\(oq=\(cq)
since the
\fIname\fR
field will never include one
itself but the
\fIvalue\fR
might.

The ID of the process group that the running
\fBsudo\fR
process is a member of.
Only available starting with API version 1.2.
.TP 6n
pid=int
The process ID of the running
\fBsudo\fR
process.
Only available starting with API version 1.2.
.TP 6n
plugin_options
Any (non-comment) strings immediately after the plugin path are
passed as arguments to the plugin.
These arguments are split on a white space boundary and are passed to
the plugin in the form of a
\fRNULL\fR-terminated
array of strings.
If no arguments were
specified,
\fIplugin_options\fR
will be the
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
.sp
NOTE: the
\fIplugin_options\fR
parameter is only available starting with
API version 1.2.
A plugin
\fBmust\fR
check the API version specified
by the
\fBsudo\fR
front end before using
\fIplugin_options\fR.
Failure to do so may result in a crash.

finishes.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
exit_status
The command's exit status, as returned by the
wait(2)
system call.
The value of
\fRexit_status\fR
is undefined if
\fRerror\fR
is non-zero.
.TP 6n

.sp
The
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function is called by
\fBsudo\fR
to determine
whether the user is allowed to run the specified commands.
.sp
If the
\fIsudoedit\fR
option was enabled in the
\fIsettings\fR
array
passed to the
\fBopen\fR()
function, the user has requested
\fIsudoedit\fR
mode.
\fIsudoedit\fR
is a mechanism for editing one or more files
where an editor is run with the user's credentials instead of with
elevated privileges.
\fBsudo\fR
achieves this by creating user-writable
temporary copies of the files to be edited and then overwriting the
originals with the temporary copies after editing is complete.
If the plugin supports
\fIsudoedit\fR,
it should choose the editor to be used, potentially from a variable
in the user's environment, such as
\fREDITOR\fR,
and include it in
\fIargv_out\fR
(note that environment
variables may include command line options).
The files to be edited should be copied from
\fIargv\fR
into
\fIargv_out\fR,
separated from the
editor and its arguments by a
\(lq\fR--\fR\(rq
element.
The
\(lq\fR--\fR\(rq
will
be removed by
\fBsudo\fR
before the editor is executed.
The plugin should also set
\fIsudoedit=true\fR
in the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.sp
The
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function returns 1 if the command is allowed,
0 if not allowed, \-1 for a general error, or \-2 for a usage error
or if
\fIsudoedit\fR
was specified but is unsupported by the plugin.
In the latter case,
\fBsudo\fR
will print a usage message before it
exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
\fBconversation\fR()
or
\fBplugin_printf\fR()
function with
\fRSUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG\fR
to present additional error information to the user.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
argc
The number of elements in
\fIargv\fR,
not counting the final
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
.TP 6n
argv
The argument vector describing the command the user wishes to run,
in the same form as what would be passed to the
execve(2)
system call.
The vector is terminated by a
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
.TP 6n
env_add
Additional environment variables specified by the user on the command
line in the form of a
\fRNULL\fR-terminated
vector of
\(lqname=value\(rq
strings.
The plugin may reject the command if one or more variables
are not allowed to be set, or it may silently ignore such variables.
.sp
When parsing
\fIenv_add\fR,
the plugin should split on the
\fBfirst\fR
equal sign
(\(oq=\(cq)
since the
\fIname\fR
field will never include one
itself but the
\fIvalue\fR
might.
.TP 6n
command_info
Information about the command being run in the form of
\(lqname=value\(rq
strings.
These values are used by
\fBsudo\fR
to set the execution
environment when running a command.
The plugin is responsible for creating and populating the vector,
which must be terminated with a
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
The following values are recognized by
\fBsudo\fR:
.PP
.RS 6n
.PD 0
.TP 6n
chroot=string
The root directory to use when running the command.
.PD
.TP 6n
closefrom=number
If specified,
\fBsudo\fR
will close all files descriptors with a value
of
\fInumber\fR
or higher.
.TP 6n
command=string
Fully qualified path to the command to be executed.
.TP 6n
cwd=string
The current working directory to change to when executing the command.
.TP 6n
exec_background=bool
By default,
\fBsudo\fR
runs a command as the foreground process as long as
\fBsudo\fR
itself is running in the foreground.
When
\fIexec_background\fR
is enabled and the command is being run in a pseudo-terminal
(due to I/O logging or the
\fIuse_pty\fR
setting), the command will be run as a background process.
Attempts to read from the controlling terminal (or to change terminal
settings) will result in the command being suspended with the
\fRSIGTTIN\fR
signal (or
\fRSIGTTOU\fR
in the case of terminal settings).
If this happens when
\fBsudo\fR
is a foreground process, the command will be granted the controlling terminal
and resumed in the foreground with no user intervention required.
The advantage of initially running the command in the background is that
\fBsudo\fR
need not read from the terminal unless the command explicitly requests it.
Otherwise, any terminal input must be passed to the command, whether it
has required it or not (the kernel buffers terminals so it is not possible
to tell whether the command really wants the input).
This is different from historic
\fIsudo\fR
behavior or when the command is not being run in a pseudo-terminal.
.sp
For this to work seamlessly, the operating system must support the
automatic restarting of system calls.
Unfortunately, not all operating systems do this by default,
and even those that do may have bugs.
For example, macOS fails to restart the
\fBtcgetattr\fR()
and
\fBtcsetattr\fR()
system calls (this is a bug in macOS).
Furthermore, because this behavior depends on the command stopping with the
\fRSIGTTIN\fR
or
\fRSIGTTOU\fR
signals, programs that catch these signals and suspend themselves
with a different signal (usually
\fRSIGTOP\fR)
will not be automatically foregrounded.
Some versions of the linux
su(1)
command behave this way.
Because of this, a plugin should not set
\fIexec_background\fR
unless it is explicitly enabled by the administrator and there should
be a way to enabled or disable it on a per-command basis.
.sp
This setting has no effect unless I/O logging is enabled or
\fIuse_pty\fR
is enabled.
.TP 6n
execfd=number
If specified,
\fBsudo\fR
will use the
fexecve(2)
system call to execute the command instead of
execve(2).
The specified
\fInumber\fR
must refer to an open file descriptor.
.TP 6n
iolog_compress=bool
Set to true if the I/O logging plugins, if any, should compress the
log data.
This is a hint to the I/O logging plugin which may choose to ignore it.
.TP 6n
iolog_group=string
The group that will own newly created I/O log files and directories.
This is a hint to the I/O logging plugin which may choose to ignore it.
.TP 6n
iolog_mode=octal
The file permission mode to use when creating I/O log files and directories.
This is a hint to the I/O logging plugin which may choose to ignore it.
.TP 6n
iolog_user=string
The user that will own newly created I/O log files and directories.
This is a hint to the I/O logging plugin which may choose to ignore it.
.TP 6n
iolog_path=string
Fully qualified path to the file or directory in which I/O log is
to be stored.
This is a hint to the I/O logging plugin which may choose to ignore it.
If no I/O logging plugin is loaded, this setting has no effect.
.TP 6n
iolog_stdin=bool

When an I/O plugin is loaded,
\fBsudo\fR
runs the command in a pseudo-terminal.
This makes it possible to log the input and output from the user's
session.
If any of the standard input, standard output or standard error do not
correspond to a tty,
\fBsudo\fR
will open a pipe to capture
the I/O for logging before passing it on.
.PP
The log_ttyin function receives the raw user input from the terminal
device (note that this will include input even when echo is disabled,
such as when a password is read).
The log_ttyout function receives output from the pseudo-terminal that is
suitable for replaying the user's session at a later time.
The
\fBlog_stdin\fR(),
\fBlog_stdout\fR()
and
\fBlog_stderr\fR()
functions are only called if the standard input, standard output
or standard error respectively correspond to something other than
a tty.
.PP
Any of the logging functions may be set to the
\fRNULL\fR
pointer if no logging is to be performed.
If the open function returns 0, no I/O will be sent to the plugin.
.PP
If a logging function returns an error
(\-1),
the running command will be terminated and all of the plugin's logging
functions will be disabled.
Other I/O logging plugins will still receive any remaining
input or output that has not yet been processed.
.PP
If an input logging function rejects the data by returning 0, the
command will be terminated and the data will not be passed to the
command, though it will still be sent to any other I/O logging plugins.
If an output logging function rejects the data by returning 0, the
command will be terminated and the data will not be written to the

.SS "Signal handlers"
The
\fBsudo\fR
front end installs default signal handlers to trap common signals
while the plugin functions are run.
The following signals are trapped by default before the command is
executed:
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
\fRSIGALRM\fR
.PD 0

.PD
.PP
If a fatal signal is received before the command is executed,
\fBsudo\fR
will call the plugin's
\fBclose\fR()
function with an exit status of 128 plus the value of the signal
that was received.
This allows for consistent logging of commands killed by a signal
for plugins that log such information in their
\fBclose\fR()
function.
An exception to this is
\fRSIGPIPE\fR,
which is ignored until the command is executed.
.PP
A plugin may temporarily install its own signal handlers but must
restore the original handler before the plugin function returns.
.SS "Hook function API"
Beginning with plugin API version 1.2, it is possible to install
hooks for certain functions called by the
\fBsudo\fR
front end.
.PP
Currently, the only supported hooks relate to the handling of
environment variables.
Hooks can be used to intercept attempts to get, set, or remove
environment variables so that these changes can be reflected in
the version of the environment that is used to execute a command.
A future version of the API will support hooking internal
\fBsudo\fR
front end functions as well.
.PP
\fIHook structure\fR
.PP
Hooks in
\fBsudo\fR
are described by the following structure:
.nf

The actual function arguments will vary depending on the
\fRhook_type\fR
(see
\fRhook_type\fR
above).
In all cases, the
\fRclosure\fR
field of
\fRstruct sudo_hook\fR
is passed as the last function parameter.

.PD 0
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_HOOK_RET_ERROR\fR
The hook function encountered an error.
.PD
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_HOOK_RET_NEXT\fR
The hook completed without error, go on to the next hook (including
the native implementation if applicable).
For example, a
getenv(3)
hook might return
\fRSUDO_HOOK_RET_NEXT\fR
if the specified variable was not found in the private copy of the environment.
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_HOOK_RET_STOP\fR
The hook completed without error, stop processing hooks for this invocation.
This can be used to replace the native implementation.
For example, a
\fRsetenv\fR
hook that operates on a private copy of
the environment but leaves
\fRenviron\fR
unchanged.
.PD 0
.PP
.RE
.PD
.PP
Note that it is very easy to create an infinite loop when hooking
C library functions.
For example, a
getenv(3)
hook that calls the
snprintf(3)
function may create a loop if the
snprintf(3)
implementation calls
getenv(3)
to check the locale.
To prevent this, you may wish to use a static variable in the hook
function to guard against nested calls.
For example:
.nf
.sp
.RS 0n
static int in_progress = 0; /* avoid recursion */
if (in_progress)
    return SUDO_HOOK_RET_NEXT;
in_progress = 1;

.SS "Remote command execution"
The
\fBsudo\fR
front end does not have native support for running remote commands.
However, starting with
\fBsudo\fR
1.8.8, the
\fB\-h\fR
option may be used to specify a remote host that is passed
to the policy plugin.
A plugin may also accept a
\fIrunas_user\fR
in the form of
\(lquser@hostname\(rq
which will work with older versions of
\fBsudo\fR.
It is anticipated that remote commands will be supported by executing a
\(lqhelper\(rq
program.
The policy plugin should setup the execution environment such that the
\fBsudo\fR
front end will run the helper which, in turn, will connect to the
remote host and run the command.
.PP
For example, the policy plugin could utilize
\fBssh\fR
to perform remote command execution.
The helper program would be responsible for running
\fBssh\fR
with the proper options to use a private key or certificate
that the remote host will accept and run a program
on the remote host that would setup the execution environment
accordingly.
.PP
Note that remote
\fBsudoedit\fR
functionality must be handled by the policy plugin, not
\fBsudo\fR
itself as the front end has no knowledge that a remote command is
being executed.
This may be addressed in a future revision of the plugin API.
.SS "Conversation API"
If the plugin needs to interact with the user, it may do so via the
\fBconversation\fR()
function.
A plugin should not attempt to read directly from the standard input
or the user's tty (neither of which are guaranteed to exist).
The caller must include a trailing newline in
\fRmsg\fR
if one is to be printed.
.PP
A
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function is also available that can be used to display informational
or error messages to the user, which is usually more convenient for
simple messages where no use input is required.
.PP
\fIConversation function structures\fR
.PP
The conversation function takes as arguments pointers to the following
structures:
.nf
.sp
.RS 0n
struct sudo_conv_message {
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF  0x0001 /* do not echo user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_ON   0x0002 /* echo user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG        0x0003 /* error message */
#define SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG         0x0004 /* informational message */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK      0x0005 /* mask user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OK   0x1000 /* flag: allow echo if no tty */
#define SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY       0x2000 /* flag: use tty if possible */
    int msg_type;
    int timeout;
    const char *msg;
};

#define SUDO_CONV_REPL_MAX      255

struct sudo_conv_reply {
    char *reply;
};

typedef int (*sudo_conv_callback_fn_t)(int signo, void *closure);
struct sudo_conv_callback {
    unsigned int version;
    void *closure;
    sudo_conv_callback_fn_t on_suspend;
    sudo_conv_callback_fn_t on_resume;
};
.RE
.fi
.PP
Pointers to the
\fBconversation\fR()
and
\fBprintf\fR()-style
functions are passed
in to the plugin's
\fBopen\fR()
function when the plugin is initialized.
The following type definitions can be used in the declaration of the
\fBopen\fR()
function:
.nf
.sp
.RS 0n
typedef int (*sudo_conv_t)(int num_msgs,
             const struct sudo_conv_message msgs[],
             struct sudo_conv_reply replies[],
	     struct sudo_conv_callback *callback);

typedef int (*sudo_printf_t)(int msg_type, const char *fmt, ...);
.RE
.fi
.PP
To use the
\fBconversation\fR()
function, the plugin must pass an array of
\fRsudo_conv_message\fR
and
\fRsudo_conv_reply\fR
structures.
There must be a
\fRstruct sudo_conv_message\fR
and
\fRstruct sudo_conv_reply\fR
for
each message in the conversation, that is, both arrays must have the same
number of elements.
Each
\fRstruct sudo_conv_reply\fR
must have its
\fIreply\fR
member initialized to
\fRNULL\fR.
The
\fRstruct sudo_conv_callback\fR
pointer, if not
\fRNULL\fR,
should contain function pointers to be called when the
\fBsudo\fR
process is suspended and/or resumed during conversation input.
The
\fIon_suspend\fR
and
\fIon_resume\fR
functions are called with the signal that caused
\fBsudo\fR
to be suspended and the
\fIclosure\fR
pointer from the
\fRstruct sudo_conv_callback\fR.
These functions should return 0 on success and \-1 on error.
On error, the conversation will end and the conversation function
will return a value of \-1.
The intended use is to allow the plugin to release resources, such as locks,
that should not be held indefinitely while suspended and then reacquire them
when the process is resumed.
Note that the functions are not actually invoked from within a signal handler.
.PP
The
\fImsg_type\fR
must be set to one of the following values:
.TP 6n
SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF
Prompt the user for input with echo disabled;
this is generally used for passwords.
The reply will be stored in the
\fIreplies\fR
array, and it will never be
\fRNULL\fR.
.TP 6n
SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_ON
Prompt the user for input with echo enabled.
The reply will be stored in the
\fIreplies\fR
array, and it will never be
\fRNULL\fR.
.TP 6n
SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG
Display an error message.
The message is written to the standard error unless the
\fRSUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY\fR
flag is set, in which case it is written to the user's terminal if possible.
.TP 6n
SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG
Display a message.
The message is written to the standard output unless the
\fRSUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY\fR
flag is set, in which case it is written to the user's terminal if possible.
.TP 6n
SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK
Prompt the user for input but echo an asterisk character for each
character read.
The reply will be stored in the
\fIreplies\fR
array, and it will never be
\fRNULL\fR.
This can be used to provide visual feedback to the user while reading
sensitive information that should not be displayed.
.PP
In addition to the above values, the following flag bits may also be set:
.TP 6n
SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OK
Allow input to be read when echo cannot be disabled
when the message type is
\fRSUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF\fR
or
\fRSUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK\fR.
By default,
\fBsudo\fR
will refuse to read input if the echo cannot be disabled for those
message types.
.TP 6n
SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY
When displaying a message via
\fRSUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG\fR
or
\fRSUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG\fR,
try to write the message to the user's terminal.
If the terminal is unavailable, the standard error or standard output
will be used, depending upon whether
The user's terminal is always used when possible for input,
this flag is only used for output.
\fRSUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG\fR
or
\fRSUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG\fR
was used.
.PP
The
\fItimeout\fR
in seconds until the prompt will wait for no more input.
A zero value implies an infinite timeout.
.PP
The plugin is responsible for freeing the reply buffer located in each
\fRstruct sudo_conv_reply\fR,
if it is not
\fRNULL\fR.
\fRSUDO_CONV_REPL_MAX\fR
represents the maximum length of the reply buffer (not including
the trailing NUL character).
In practical terms, this is the longest password
\fBsudo\fR
will support.
It is also useful as a maximum value for the
\fBmemset_s\fR()
function when clearing passwords filled in by the conversation function.
.PP
The
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function uses the same underlying mechanism as the
\fBconversation\fR()
function but only supports
\fRSUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG\fR
and
\fRSUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG\fR
for the
\fImsg_type\fR
parameter.
It can be more convenient than using the
\fBconversation\fR()
function if no user reply is needed and supports standard
\fBprintf\fR()
escape sequences.
.PP
See the sample plugin for an example of the
\fBconversation\fR()
function usage.
.SS "Sudoers group plugin API"
The
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin supports its own plugin interface to allow non-Unix
group lookups.
This can be used to query a group source other than the standard Unix
group database.
Two sample group plugins are bundled with
\fBsudo\fR,
\fIgroup_file\fR
and
\fIsystem_group\fR,
are detailed in
sudoers(@mansectform@).
Third party group plugins include a QAS AD plugin available from Quest Software.
.PP
A group plugin must declare and populate a
\fRsudoers_group_plugin\fR
struct in the global scope.
This structure contains pointers to the functions that implement plugin
initialization, cleanup and group lookup.

The following revisions have been made to the Sudo Plugin API.
.TP 6n
Version 1.0
Initial API version.
.TP 6n
Version 1.1 (sudo 1.8.0)
The I/O logging plugin's
\fBopen\fR()
function was modified to take the
\fRcommand_info\fR
list as an argument.
.TP 6n
Version 1.2 (sudo 1.8.5)
The Policy and I/O logging plugins'
\fBopen\fR()
functions are now passed
a list of plugin parameters if any are specified in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@).
.sp
A simple hooks API has been introduced to allow plugins to hook in to the
system's environment handling functions.
.sp
The
\fRinit_session\fR
Policy plugin function is now passed a pointer
to the user environment which can be updated as needed.
This can be used to merge in environment variables stored in the PAM
handle before a command is run.
.TP 6n
Version 1.3 (sudo 1.8.7)
Support for the
\fIexec_background\fR
entry has been added to the
\fRcommand_info\fR
list.
.sp
The
\fImax_groups\fR
and
\fIplugin_dir\fR
entries were added to the
\fRsettings\fR
list.
.sp
The
\fBversion\fR()
and
\fBclose\fR()
functions are now optional.
Previously, a missing
\fBversion\fR()
or
\fBclose\fR()
function would result in a crash.
If no policy plugin
\fBclose\fR()
function is defined, a default
\fBclose\fR()
function will be provided by the
\fBsudo\fR
front end that displays a warning if the command could not be
executed.
.sp
The
\fBsudo\fR
front end now installs default signal handlers to trap common signals
while the plugin functions are run.
.TP 6n
Version 1.4 (sudo 1.8.8)
The
\fIremote_host\fR
entry was added to the
\fRsettings\fR
list.
.TP 6n
Version 1.5 (sudo 1.8.9)

\fBlog_stdin\fR(),
\fBlog_stdout\fR(),
or
\fBlog_stderr\fR()
function returned an error.
